# Updater
A tool used to execute commands intended to update legacy sites "the old way". However, it can be used as a simple task runner. It is designed to be easily extendable.

# How to use:
Let's say you have named the application _updater.exe_ and have it in your PATH variable. In command prompt, execute the following command - _updater prod_. Note that there is a prod.upd file that contains the script. This files consists of commands - one command per line. If a line starts with '#', then the whole line is ignored. This is used for to have comments in the scripts.

Supported commands are:
* ZipToFolder zipFileName folderPath
* CleanFolder folderPath [list of file extensions to clear]
* FolderToZip folderPath zipFileName
* FolderToFolder sourceFolderPath destinationFolderPath
* BackupSql connectionString backupDatabase backupFolder 
* DeleteFolder folderPath

**REMARK 1** You can use $dateIdentifier$ in the filename. It will be replaced with yyyyMMdd string corresponding with the current date.

**REMARK 2** The command and arguments are separated not by spaces but by tabs. This way it is easier when the arguments contain spaces, e.g., folder names.

One example scenario that we automate is:
* Backup the database
* Unzip the installation package in a temp folder
* Remove all *.config and *.sitemap files
* Copy temp folder content into the application installation directory
* Remove temp folder
